Just click the link and it will render your approximate location. Mobile results will vary if you're connected to 3g/4g/LTE.

I could have utilized the built-in HTML geolocation feature instead of the API, but that requires the user to accept permission. I wanted this to serve as a simple educational resource for showing the metadata that is attached an IP address.
